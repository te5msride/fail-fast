Applying for post-doc, here's my CV. I've been reading your work, these are the things I would like to do with your work.

After sitting in on your plenary at ICRA, I really started diving into your work. 

It fascinated me how uniquely 

Your talk really gave me a realization that there really is not a reason for prosthetics to be so shitty in terms of control scheme. We have sensing capabilities inside our bodies that are so data-rich, and unifying the data with low-level representations that can determine intent is genius with magnetomicrometry and agonist-antagonist interfaces. 

I believe your work dealing with variable stiffness mechanisms for prostheses 


#todo Rewrite the VIA paper, change terminology, add mechanical modeling/FBD, perhaps some kind of discussion on how it has effectiveness for being put in parallel with a locking mechanism

5. Get to know the staff of your department.
6. Rejection is a part of science and engineering.
