Here's some information regarding Ramya for the Goldwater scholarship

1. **Dependability & Initiative**: One of the qualities I noticed in Ramya was her dependability.  I've had experiences with other TAMS students who would either require repeated instructions or just vanish, but not Ramya. She consistently surprised me by how efficiently she completed tasks and how swiftly she grasped the nuances of her duties. Her dependability was particularly evident when it came to curing the samples – she ensured they were consistently well-prepared and timely, probably curing 100-150 of the samples we used for the materials paper.
    
2. **Proactivity in Learning & Contribution**: Beyond her designated tasks, Ramya showcased a genuine interest in the broader aspects of our research. She took the initiative to understand and contribute to the statistical analyses once we started delving into the data for our paper. This enthusiasm for understanding and contributing to multiple aspects of the project set her apart. Additionally, she took on the responsibility of going through related papers for our review. Not only did she read them, but she also summarized the critical information I had requested, showcasing her ability to grasp and distill complex information.
    
3. **Transition & Adaptability**: Ramya’s transition coming into the lab from a chemistry background to biomedical engineering demonstrates her adaptability and versatility. This, combined with her personal connection to the field due to her previous injuries, speaks volumes about her dedication and passion.
    

In summary, Ramya has been a great help in the lab as we've worked to publish papers. Her dedication, proactiveness, and genuine interest in our research make her an exemplary candidate for the Goldwater Scholarship.
